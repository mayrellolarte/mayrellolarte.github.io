      <h3>PROFILE</h3>
      <p>An Information Systems student with a passion for technology and a knack for computers, I'm eager to explore various opportunities in freelancing to further enhance my skills and gain valuable experience for my future endeavors. But beyond tech, I‚Äôm a <span class="highlight">social butterfly</span> who thrives on meeting new people, trying new things, and making the most out of every moment.</p>

    <section id="about-me">
      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p>I‚Äôm an <span class="highlight">extrovert</span>‚Äîsuper outgoing, always ready to strike up a conversation, and honestly, I can talk about <span class="highlight">anything and everything</span>. Whether it‚Äôs tech, music, sports, or random trivia, I‚Äôm your person. I love <span class="highlight">singing</span>, playing the <span class="highlight">guitar</span>, and geeking out over music. When I‚Äôm not doing that, you‚Äôll probably catch me watching movies or playing <span class="highlight">football</span>, <span class="highlight">basketball</span>, <span class="highlight">billiards</span>, or even <span class="highlight">volleyball</span>.</p>
      <p>But if we‚Äôre being real? My absolute favorite thing to do is <span class="highlight">sleep</span>. And talk. A lot. (Yapp!) I‚Äôm also the type of person who grabs every opportunity that comes my way. I love <span class="highlight">trying new things</span>, exploring new places, and just making the most out of life. Call me <span class="highlight">adventurous</span>‚Äîbecause if there‚Äôs something exciting happening, I‚Äôm probably already on my way. I have <span class="highlight">lots of energy</span>, and I‚Äôm always ready to go anywhere, do anything, and take on whatever challenge comes next!</p>
